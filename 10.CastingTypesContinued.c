Casting Types Continued
A more interesting casting option is converting a char to a number type, or the other way around. Just like before, you have to be careful how you set this up. In the back-end, a char doesn’t store 'a', it stores the value representing that: 97 for lowercase and 65 for uppercase.

int targetInt;
char sourceChar = 'a';
targetInt = (int)sourceChar;
Now targetInt equals 97.

When you cast an int to a char, you get the opposite process and the char is set to the value at the int value. So if you did:

int sourceInt = 65;
char targetChar;
targetChar = (char)sourceInt;
targetChar now equals 'A'.

Instructions
1.
If 'a' is 97, what do you suppose we would get if we set an int to 99 and cast it to a char? Let’s find out. The initial state is set so you need to cast our sourceInt to targetChar.

Set targetChar equal to sourceInt and explicitly cast it by using (char).

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
<target> = (char)<source>
where

2.
Now let’s see what happens when you cast a double into a char. Set targetChar to sourceDouble using implicit casting (no type identifier for the cast).
