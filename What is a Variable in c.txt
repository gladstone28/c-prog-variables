VARIABLES: LESSON
What is a Variable in C?
In this lesson you will learn about:

The rules for naming variables in C.
The main data types in C: int, float, double, and char.
Declaring and initializing data types in C, as well as changing their value.
Casting from one data type to another, and some potential limitations in C.
Letâ€™s start with what a variable is. It is a reference used to store information for future use. For instance, int score can be called later in your code to assign, change, compare, etc. In this example, you can see the basic structure of variable creation (known as declaration) is type variable_name. Have no fear, we will go over each part of this and more in this lesson. Specifically, we will cover how to create, name, assign, modify, and convert them to different types.

As a bonus tip right from the start, you can create more than one variable of the same type at a time by listing them with commas between their names, like type variable1, variable_2, variable_3, variable4.
